# Essential-Skills-Website
# The Essential Skills module encourages students to develop a wide variety of skills by
pursuing several Continued Professional Development (CPD) activities. This process
requires that students reflect and report upon their own learning, performance and
achievement. To support this task, students require an accessible medium with which
to capture and present information to their tutors.
This Web assignment has been designed to allow students to practice authoring,
organising, and formatting information using HTML and CSS for assessment. The
assignment is also expected to provide students with a mechanism to collect, format
and present information relating to their wider CPD activities this term.
